# BBallPlayerGenerator
Tool to generate a basketball player (or many)

##Cloning the project
1. Make sure you have access to Andrew Ammentorp's public key (available upon request)
2. Clone using SSH

##Initial Setup
1. This project uses a maven dependency to generate fake names so you will probably have to install that
2. Due to the gitignore you also might have to configure src/main/java/view/LocalRunner.java
as the project runner

##Running the project
From here you basically are in charge. Feel free to generate a player with the parameters you wish using Java!
